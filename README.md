# Smart-Carpool

This project is an after-school dismissal management system. It is intended to speed up school deperatures to reduce the strain on traffic within the community.

Machine Learning: We built a machine learning model to create a license-plate scanner to quickly send students outside
Google Firebase: We integrated the app with Google Firebase to provide instant connectivity for all users

Ways to Send Students Out:
- License Plate Scanner: Scan the license plate of a car, which is then encrypted using SHA-256 and sent to the database to be compared
- QR Code Scanner: Scans a QR code created when adding the student to the database
- Manual: Teachers click on the students name to tell the supervisors inside the classroom to send the students out
